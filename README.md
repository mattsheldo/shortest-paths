# Shortest Paths Algorithms

I completed this code for my algorithms class. The code compares two different algorithms for calculating the shortest path between any and every node of a graph. The first algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm and the second algorithm is the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The main purpose of this code is compare the run time of the two algorithm's with different sizes of graphs.

## Try it Yourself!

Use Git to clone the repository and run the program. On your machine navigate to your desired folder and run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattsheldo/shortest-paths.git
```

Once you have the repository cloned on your machine you can run the following commands to compile and run the code.

To Compile:
```bash
g++ main.cpp Timer.cpp
```
To Run:
```bash
./a.out
```
